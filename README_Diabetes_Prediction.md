# README - Diabetes Prediction Project

## Project Title
**Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning**

## Description
This project involves building and evaluating various machine learning models to predict the likelihood of diabetes based on health and lifestyle-related features. The dataset was preprocessed, visualized, and analyzed using Python libraries. Models include Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, and k-NN.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- PyPlot

## Models Implemented
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)

## Dataset
The dataset used was a cleaned diabetes dataset stored in Google Drive and loaded using Pandas.

## Key Features
- Data Cleaning and Deduplication
- Outlier Detection and Handling
- Feature Selection and Encoding
- Data Visualization
- Model Training and Evaluation
- User Input for Real-Time Prediction

## Usage
Run the script in a Jupyter notebook or Google Colab environment. Follow the prompts to enter user input for real-time diabetes prediction using the final trained SVM model.
